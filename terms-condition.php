                    <p>
                      Before you start using our services, we ask you to read
                      our Terms of Service carefully. These terms create a legal
                      agreement between you and Smart Sellers that governs your
                      use of our services.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>

                      By using the Smart Sellers website and services, you agree
                      to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any
                      part of these terms, you should not use our services.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Changes to Terms of Service</h3>

                      Smart Sellers reserves the right to modify these terms at
                      any time. Any changes will become effective when we post
                      the revised terms on the site.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Accessing our Services</h3>
                    <p>
                      You may use our services only if you can legally form
                      binding contracts and are not barred from receiving
                      services under applicable laws.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Subscriptions and User Plans</h3>

                      Smart Sellers offers various subscription plans to provide
                      access to different levels of services and features. By
                      subscribing to a plan, you agree to the following terms:

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>1. Subscription Period and Renewal:</strong>
                        Subscriptions are billed on a periodic basis as
                        specified at the time of purchase. Your subscription
                        will automatically renew at the end of each billing
                        period unless you cancel it.
                      </li>

                        Sellers reserves the right to change the subscription
                        plans and pricing at any time. Any changes will be
                        communicated to you and will take effect at the start of
                        your next billing period.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Payments</h3>
                    <p>
                      Payment gateways are also an important factor to consider.
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        You must provide a valid payment method (e.g., credit
                        card) to pay for your subscription. Smart Sellers will
                        charge your payment method on the billing date.
                      </li>

                        <strong>2. Billing Information:</strong> You agree to
                        provide accurate and complete billing information and
                        update it as necessary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>3. Failed Payments:</strong> If a payment is not
                        successfully processed, due to expiration, insufficient
                        funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account,
                        we may suspend your access to the service until we have
                        successfully charged a valid payment method.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
